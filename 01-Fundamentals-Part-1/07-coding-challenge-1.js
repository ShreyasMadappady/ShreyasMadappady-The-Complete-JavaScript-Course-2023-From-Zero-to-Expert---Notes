/* Coding Challenge #1
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).

Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall. */

// Test Data 1
// const markWeight = 78;
// const markHeight = 1.69;
// const johnWeight = 92;
// const johnHeight = 1.95;

// Test Data 2
const markWeight = 95;
const markHeight = 1.88;
const johnWeight = 85;
const johnHeight = 1.76;

const markBMI = markWeight / markHeight ** 2;
const johnBMI = johnWeight / (johnHeight * johnHeight);
console.log(`Mark BMI ${markBMI}`);
// Test 1: Mark BMI 27.309968138370508
// Test 2: Mark BMI 26.87867813490267
console.log(`John BMI ${johnBMI}`);
// Test 1: John BMI 24.194608809993426
// Test 2:  John BMI 27.44059917355372

const markHigherBMI = markBMI > johnBMI;
console.log(`Mark has higher BMI than John - ${markHigherBMI}`);
// Test 1: Mark has higher BMI than John - true
// Test 2: Mark has higher BMI than John - false
