// Variable naming convention
// 1- Variables name should not start with a number let 5name = "George" is going to through a syntax error

// 2- Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores or $ (dollar) sign if I try to declare a variable name first&name is going to through an error on the console

// 3- Variable names should not be same to reserved language words for example <i>new</i> or <i>function</i>.

// 4- Variable names should not start with uppercase letter let Person, usually this syntax is being used for classes in JS

// 5- Constants should be written in uppercase, so it is easy to understand that the value store is not going to change. let PI = 3.14

// 6- Variables name should be descriptive
